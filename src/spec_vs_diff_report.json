      "reason": "The code still references the same Kuldeep image path (/assets/generated/founder-kuldeep.dim_512x512.jpg) and the diff summary does not include any added/modified static asset image file indicating the uploaded real photo was actually placed into the frontend assets or that any previous image was removed/fully dereferenced across the UI.",

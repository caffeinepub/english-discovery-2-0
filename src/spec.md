# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Swap the displayed name labels for Saloni Singh and Sumit Shrivastav in the Home page “Our Team” section.

**Planned changes:**
- Update `frontend/src/components/FoundersSection.tsx` so the first (left-most) team card displays the name “Saloni Singh”.
- Update `frontend/src/components/FoundersSection.tsx` so the second (middle) team card displays the name “Sumit Shrivastav”.
- Ensure only the displayed names change; photos, roles/titles, ordering, and all other content remain unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page, the first team card shows “Saloni Singh” and the second team card shows “Sumit Shrivastav”, with all images and roles unchanged.

# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the Founder (Kuldeep) image on the website with the newly uploaded real photo and ensure the old Kuldeep image is not used anywhere.

**Planned changes:**
- Add the uploaded real Kuldeep photo as a static frontend asset and use it in the Home page “Our Team”/Founders section.
- Remove/replace all references to the previous Kuldeep founder image so it is no longer displayed anywhere in the UI.
- Ensure the new image renders cleanly in the existing circular avatar (centered crop, no distortion) and that the existing image path remains valid to avoid broken images.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated real Founder (Kuldeep) photo in the Home page “Our Team” section, with no remaining instances of the old Kuldeep photo across the site.
